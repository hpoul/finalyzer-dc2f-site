and make sure it is invested correctly? Then it is time to learn the
basics of investing into individual stocks.</p>
<h1>Step 1: Things to consider</h1>
<p>Before getting into the weeds you have to understand the risks
and challenges before pulling the trigger on your investments.</p>
<p>First of all: <strong>How much are you willing to invest</strong>? Make
sure that you invest regularly, but only money you know you
will not need in the near future. Although the stock market
presents good opportunities, you don&rsquo;t ever want to sell just
because you need the money. You can be sure this will <em>not</em> be
the best time to sell.</p>
<p>As an individual investor you should also make sure you
understand all the risks and typically only invest your own money
once you have no remaining debt. Trying to trade on margins is a
risky business.</p>
<p>Make sure to <strong>plan for the long term</strong>. Most gains for individual
investors come from investing in <strong>good companies</strong> and keeping
them for the long term!</p>

    <h4>Choosing the right broker</h4>

<h1>Step 2: Choose a broker that fits your needs</h1>
<p>Which broker is right for you depends very much on your personal
situation, existing back affiliations and location.</p>
<p>The most important thing to consider is to
<strong>keep fees low</strong>. This involves trading of stocks as well as
how much you pay monthly for the portfolio and for each
individual stock. Also keep an eye on which stock exchanges
the broker offers and how much they charge for each. If you
trade foreign stocks you also have to consider currency
conversion fees!</p>
<p>Some good brokers with small fees include:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you are in the US: <a href="https://robinhood.com/">Robinhood</a></li>
<li>Within the EU: <a href="https://degiro.eu">DEGIRO</a></li>
</ul>
<h1>Step 3: Finding great Public Companies and good investments</h1>
<p>Now to the fun part! Deciding where you want to actually invest your money in.
Make sure to take your time to look at past performances of companies,
and that you understand their core business. Make sure to chose your
investments on your opinion on the company, their strategy and how
much you think they will succeed over the coming years. <strong>Do not
try to just analyze the ticker charts</strong> to come up with your future productions.</p>
<p>Even when starting with a small investment. Make sure that you get
a <strong>diversified portfolio</strong>. This might include up to five to ten stocks,
depending how much money you are able to invest.</p>
<p>If you only buy a small position in a stock, make sure to keep an eye on
the fees of your broker. You don&rsquo;t want to have a good stock just to realize that
all your market gains are eaten away by the fees.</p>

<h1>Step 4: Hold, Observe and Learn</h1>
<p>As long as nothing fundamentally changes in the companies you have
invested in, you should usually hold them as long as possible.
You have chosen winning companies, after all.</p>
<p>To keep <strong>track of your investments</strong> make sure to add your positions
to <a href="https://anlage.app/">Anlage.App</a> to easily know where your
portfolio is trending and if your investment strategy is working.</p>
