is to invest in companies of foreign countries. Although this
minimizes the overall risk of the stock portfolio it typically
exposes the investment to more risk or fluctuations.</p>
<ul>
<li>Dealing in <strong>foreign currencies adds additional risk</strong>.</li>
<li>Might increase fees from your broker.</li>
<li>Can add currency exchange fees on top of trading fees.</li>
<li>Different markets might have different regulations regarding <strong>financial oversight, taxes and reports</strong>.</li>
<li>When tracking the performance of your stocks you have to separate the performance of the company stock from the currency.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Why invest in foreign markets?</h2>
<p>There are a few good reasons to diversify into foreign markets.</p>
<p>First, if you are living outside the US it is obviously the best way
to invest in fast growing technology companies. It&rsquo;s typically
favorable to invest directly in for example Alphabet or Microsoft
directly at the NASDAQ instead of <strong>dual listings on your local market</strong>.
The main reason is that the main listing have much larger
volumes/liquidity so it is easier to buy and sell stocks.</p>
<p>But even if you live in the US you should take a good look at
companies of foreign markets. For example the Australian (ASX),
UK or German markets should be a good way to minimize the risk
from a short term US correction.</p>
<h2>Discovering foreign Stock Opportunities</h2>
<p>There is not a big difference to <strong>discovering investing
opportunities</strong> in your home market. In today&rsquo;s world chances
are you are regularly interacting with foreign companies.
From Adidas to Volkswagen in the German market, HSBC, BP and
Unilever in the UK market (FTSE) or even Softbank, Toyota or
Sony in the Japanese Market (TYO). Keep an eye out for
news of foreign companies, and maybe <strong>check the 52 week lows
or highs charts</strong> to find investing opportunities.</p>

<h2>Foreign Currency Considerations</h2>
<p>The biggest hurdle for keeping track of foreign stocks is to
calculate in currency exchange rates. So in addition to the
ups and downs of the value of the companies you invest in you
will experience changes of currency conversion.</p>
<p>Usually you want to <strong>keep track of the performance of your
stocks</strong> to know how your investment thesis holds true.
In this sense looking at the price of your shares in your
home currency is probably quite distracting from the real
development. So you should also look at the reports in the
native currency of the foreign stock exchange.</p>
<h2>Fees, Taxes and regulations</h2>
<p>Since you are dealing with companies and markets outside your
home country you can&rsquo;t expect them to follow the same regulations.
So you obvious can&rsquo;t expect your quarterly
and yearly SEC filings from stocks listed outside the US jurisdiction.</p>
<p>So you might want to find out what the local regulations are, bit
typically nowadays you can be pretty certain that every bigger
market has similar rules. For example there is the
&ldquo;Financial Services Agency&rdquo; in Japan and the
&ldquo;Bundesanstalt f√ºr Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht&rdquo; for Germany.
Similar to annual reports to the SEC German companies have to
publish their <a href="https://www.bundesanzeiger.de/ebanzwww/wexsservlet?session.sessionid=c6d59e4ed54a86a8e1a9b08da86f8cc9&amp;global_data.designmode=eb&amp;genericsearch_param.fulltext=Volkswagen&amp;genericsearch_param.part_id=22&amp;%28page.navid%3Dto_quicksearchlist%29=Suchen">reports publicly as well and can be searched at
bundesanzeiger.de</a>.</p>
<p>Another thing to keep in mind is that your broker <strong>might charge
extra fees</strong> for transactions in foreign such exchanges, even if
he actually supports them in the first place. So make sure you
understand what your broker realistically allows you.</p>
<p>In addition you should make sure if there are any additional taxes
in the country you want to invest and trade in. And whether there
are double tax agreements between your home country and the country
of the exchange you are trading in. Typically your broker should
charge any country specific taxes, but if there are treaties in
place you might be able to be exempt from some taxes. So you might
want to get in touch with your broker or accountant.</p>
