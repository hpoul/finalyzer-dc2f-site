Another rather disappointing week for most stock indexes. 
But if compared to cryptocurrencies the stock market performed 
pretty well! Bitcoin is down almost 11% last week.

I guess with cryptocurrencies this kind of instability is expected. 
So keep this in mind when reading the 2% loss of the S&P 500 index and 
-1.27% of NASDAQ Composite!

Generally technology stocks seem to have been quite poor performer 
overall. With Facebook continuing the down turn and having another 
-5% loss. On the other side of the spectrum is still 
Coca Cola - which continues it's 52 week high. Probably 
it's all those Santa Clauses popping up everywhere, spreading Coca Cola's 
brand colors ;-)

So who have been the biggest winners and losers this week? [Bombardier got a
 boost of 15.9% thanks to resolving some regulatory issues](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bombardier-rebounds-citi-says-quebec-151334684.html) and rebounding 
 from the previous week. One of the biggest losers is ethereum. I guess you 
 can't just grow in popularity forever, but as always with cryptocurrencies: 
[Nobody really knows why this happened. Probably a general lack of trust in 
cryptocurrencies](https://ethereumprice.org/updates/another-market-crash-is-ethereum-still-relevant/). So better stick to stocks, as there are at least analysts 
who try to rationalize market performances.
