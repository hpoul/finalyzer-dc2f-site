Happy Holidays everyone! Maybe it is time to stop looking at your 
portfolio for this year. ü§∑Ô∏è Or if you still have money left 
after your holiday shopping to get some **cheap US stocks**.

It has been a rather disappointing week with another **5% drop** of the S&P 500, and even 
**6% drop for the NASDAQ Composite**. If you look at the graphic below 
it seems like the only winners were Canadian Gold producers.

What is even more disappointing are everyone favorite FANG stocks. 
With Facebook, Alphabet and Apple reaching 52 week lows. Netflix 
is also down 9% since last week! You can [follow the FANG stocks in our
