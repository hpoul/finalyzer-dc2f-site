One way to add additional diversification to a stock portfolio 
is to invest in companies of foreign countries. Although this 
minimizes the overall risk of the stock portfolio it typically 
exposes the investment to more risk or fluctuations.

- Dealing in **foreign currencies adds additional risk**.
- Might increase fees from your broker.
- Can add currency exchange fees on top of trading fees.
- Different markets might have different regulations regarding **financial oversight, taxes and reports**.
- When tracking the performance of your stocks you have to separate the performance of the company stock from the currency.

## Why invest in foreign markets?

There are a few good reasons to diversify into foreign markets.

First, if you are living outside the US it is obviously the best way 
to invest in fast growing technology companies. It's typically 
favorable to invest directly in for example Alphabet or Microsoft 
directly at the NASDAQ instead of **dual listings on your local market**. 
The main reason is that the main listing have much larger 
volumes/liquidity so it is easier to buy and sell stocks.

But even if you live in the US you should take a good look at 
companies of foreign markets. For example the Australian (ASX), 
UK or German markets should be a good way to minimize the risk 
from a short term US correction.

## Discovering foreign Stock Opportunities

There is not a big difference to **discovering investing 
opportunities** in your home market. In today's world chances 
are you are regularly interacting with foreign companies. 
From Adidas to Volkswagen in the German market, HSBC, BP and 
Unilever in the UK market (FTSE) or even Softbank, Toyota or 
Sony in the Japanese Market (TYO). Keep an eye out for 
news of foreign companies, and maybe **check the 52 week lows 
or highs charts** to find investing opportunities.

## Foreign Currency Considerations

The biggest hurdle for keeping track of foreign stocks is to 
calculate in currency exchange rates. So in addition to the 
ups and downs of the value of the companies you invest in you 
will experience changes of currency conversion.

Usually you want to **keep track of the performance of your 
stocks** to know how your investment thesis holds true. 
In this sense looking at the price of your shares in your 
home currency is probably quite distracting from the real 
development. So you should also look at the reports in the 
native currency of the foreign stock exchange.

## Fees, Taxes and regulations

Since you are dealing with companies and markets outside your 
home country you can't expect them to follow the same regulations. 
So you obvious can't expect your quarterly 
and yearly SEC filings from stocks listed outside the US jurisdiction.

So you might want to find out what the local regulations are, bit 
typically nowadays you can be pretty certain that every bigger 
market has similar rules. For example there is the 
"Financial Services Agency" in Japan and the 
"Bundesanstalt f√ºr Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht" for Germany. 
Similar to annual reports to the SEC German companies have to 
publish their [reports publicly as well and can be searched at 
bundesanzeiger.de](https://www.bundesanzeiger.de/ebanzwww/wexsservlet?session.sessionid=c6d59e4ed54a86a8e1a9b08da86f8cc9&global_data.designmode=eb&genericsearch_param.fulltext=Volkswagen&genericsearch_param.part_id=22&%28page.navid%3Dto_quicksearchlist%29=Suchen).

Another thing to keep in mind is that your broker **might charge 
extra fees** for transactions in foreign such exchanges, even if 
he actually supports them in the first place. So make sure you 
understand what your broker realistically allows you.

In addition you should make sure if there are any additional taxes 
in the country you want to invest and trade in. And whether there 
are double tax agreements between your home country and the country 
of the exchange you are trading in. Typically your broker should 
charge any country specific taxes, but if there are treaties in 
place you might be able to be exempt from some taxes. So you might 
want to get in touch with your broker or accountant.
